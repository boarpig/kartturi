Kartturi
========

Simple map maker script for personal use to make larger maps out of 
{karttapaikka}(http://kansalaisen.karttapaikka.fi)'s maps. It will fetch
frames from the server and put them together into a larger map.

**Note!** Using this tool to make maps might violate karttapaikka's Terms of 
Service so I've added an adjustable 2 seconds delay between server requests to 
avoid DOSing the server. I've only provided the code as a learning tool. If you
really need larger maps, I recommed you buy them directly from National Land 
Survey of Finland.
